        <h2>Kasha~Lazy Cabbage Rolls</h2>
        <p>
            Kasha, or lazy cabbage rolls, is a casserole made with all the staples of a
            cabbage roll, but with a fraction of the time and effort. You can find plenty 
            of recipes for lazy cabbage rolls online, but ours is a vegetarian version 
            (our family has a variety of food allergies and preferences, so most recipes are vegetarian as a default),
            and in my opinion, the ultimate comfort food. Sweet and savoury tomato sauce mixed in with cabbage and rice, it makes a lovely
            addition to a holiday meal, and adds a little twist to your regular fare.
