        <h3>Classic Cottage Cheese Perogies</h3>
        <p>This recipe, picked up from my Great-Grandmother's recipe book by my Nana, her daughter-in-law,
            has become a staple in our family. My mother has been in charge of making the perogies for all
            our holiday dinners for as long as I can remember, and I learned young how to effectively assemble 
            these delicious potato dumplings.
